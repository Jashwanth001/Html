	<h1>I will Donate Blood</h1>
	<ul>
	<p>Most people can give blood if they are in good health. There are some basic requirements one  need to fulfill in order to become a blood donor.  Below are some basic eligibility guidelines:

<h3>Age:</h3>

You are aged between 18 and 65.

	<li>In some countries national legislation permits 16–17 year-olds to donate provided that they fulfil the physical and hematological criteria required and that appropriate consent is obtained.</li>

	<li>In some countries, regular donors over the age of 65 may be accepted at the discretion of the responsible physician. The upper age limit in some countries are 60.</li>


<h3>Weight:</h3>

You weigh at least 50 kg.    

<li>In some countries, donors of whole blood donations should weigh at least 45 kg to donate 350 ml ± 10% .</li>


<h3>Health:</h3>     

<li>You must be in good health at the time you donate.</li>

You cannot donate if you have a cold, flu, sore throat, cold sore, stomach bug or any other infection.

<li>If you have recently had a tattoo or body piercing you cannot donate for 6 months from the date of the procedure.  If the body piercing was performed by a registered health professional and any inflammation has settled completely, you can donate blood after 12 hours.</li>

<li>If you have visited the dentist for a minor procedure you must wait 24 hours before donating; for major work wait a month.</li>

<li>You must not donate blood If you do not meet the minimum haemoglobin level for blood donation</li>

<li>A test will be administered at the donation site. In many countries, a haemoglobin level of not less than 12.0 g/dl for females and not less than 13.0 g/dl for males as the threshold.</li>

<h3>Travel:</h3>

<li>Travel to areas where mosquito-borne infections are endemic, e.g. malaria, dengue and Zika virus infections, may result in a temporary deferral.</li>

<li>Many countries also implemented the policy to defer blood donors with a history of travel or residence for defined cumulative exposure periods in specified countries or areas, as a measure to reduce the risk of transmitting variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) by blood transfusion.</li>

<h3>Behaviours:</h3>

You must not give blood:

<li>If you engaged in “at risk” sexual activity in the past 12 months</li>

<b>Individuals with behaviours below will be deferred permanently:</b> 

<li>Have ever had a positive test for HIV (AIDS virus)</li>

<li>Have ever injected recreational drugs.</li>

<li>In the national blood donor selection guidelines, there are more behavior eligibility criteria. Criteria could be different in different countries.</li>

<b>Pregnancy and breastfeeding:</b>

Following pregnancy, the deferral period should last as many months as the duration of the pregnancy.

<li>It is not advisable to donate blood while breast-feeding. Following childbirth, the deferral period is at least 9 months (as for pregnancy) and until 3 months after your baby is significantly weaned (i.e. getting most of his/her nutrition from solids or bottle feeding).</li></p></ul>
